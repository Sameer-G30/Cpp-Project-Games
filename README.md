# C-Project
Minigames project composing of Hand-Cricket, Tic-Tac-Toe and Snake Game made in C++

A C++ console-based collection of mini-games — Hand Cricket, Snake Game, and Tic-Tac-Toe — built using object-oriented programming principles and logical algorithms. Each game offers a unique challenge, interactive gameplay, and real-time feedback through console output.

Tech Stack:
Language: C++
Concepts Used: OOP (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism), Random Number Generation, Minimax Algorithm, Console I/O
Libraries: <iostream>, <ctime>, <cstdlib>, <conio.h>, <windows.h>, <string>

Features:
Hand Cricket: Play against the computer using randomization and basic AI for toss and gameplay logic.
Snake Game: Classic snake movement and food collection with user-defined difficulty levels.
Tic-Tac-Toe: Player vs Computer mode using the Minimax Algorithm for optimal AI moves.
Interactive console interface with score tracking and replay options.

Highlights:
Implements both procedural and object-oriented logic in one project.
Demonstrates integration of multiple small games within a single C++ program.
Reinforces understanding of user-defined functions, class handling, and simple AI.

Future Scope:
Add GUI using SFML or SDL2, expand to multiplayer modes, and implement persistent score tracking.
